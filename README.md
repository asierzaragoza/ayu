# Ayu
Ayu (not an acronym) is a subcellular location predictor for **marine** prokaryotic proteins, based on amino amino acid composition features. It is adapted for its use in large metagenomic datasets.

## Requirements
Ayu requires both [SignalP6.0](https://github.com/fteufel/signalp-6.0) and [TMBed](https://github.com/BernhoferM/TMbed) to be installed in order to use the `easy-workflow` command. If SignalP and TMBed are going to be run separately (See [Can I use different programs for transmembrane and signal peptide prediction?](#can-i-use-different-programs-for-transmembrane-and-signal-peptide-prediction)), this is not required.

## Installation

## Usage

### Running SignalP6 and TMBed separately
Prediction of signal peptide and transmembrane regions is the most time and resource-consuming step of the process. Therefore, some users might prefer to run TMBed and SignalP6 separately (or in a computer cluster) in order to speed up the process.
